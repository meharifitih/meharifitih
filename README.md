# Hi, I'm Mehari Fitihamlak ðŸ‘‹

Backend Software Engineer specializing in Go.

I build secure, containerized microservices and scalable PostgreSQL schemas. My recent work includes developing social/group-buying platforms and payment integrations. I focus on creating reliable, data-intensive services using REST, gRPC, and WebSockets.

**Skills:**
* **Languages & Frameworks:** Go (gRPC, Gin, gqlgen), GraphQL, SQL, JavaScript (React basics)
* **Data:** PostgreSQL, Elasticsearch, MongoDB Atlas
* **Architecture:** Microservices, REST/GraphQL gateways, real-time messaging
* **DevOps:** Docker, CI/CD fundamentals, observability

**Featured Projects:**
* **Go gRPC + GraphQL Microservices:** A production-style sample with Account, Catalog, and Order services behind a GraphQL gateway. It demonstrates typed gRPC contracts and standardized builds with Docker Compose and Make.
* **Full-Text Search Engine (Go):** An in-memory search engine that implements tokenization, stop-word filtering, and an inverted index. It supports AND/OR phrase queries with scoring.
